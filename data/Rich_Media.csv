The idea for RAGify came to me while analysing the financial performance of leading tech firms. My goal was to uncover losses recorded by these companies to understand their overall market situations. The most reliable source of such information was the 10-K filings submitted to SEC EDGAR, which are publicly available and packed with valuable data.

However, manually sifting through these reports for precise insights was time-consuming and inefficient. This led to the creation of RAGify, a system designed to:
? Retrieve exact sections from 10-K filings based on user queries.
? Provide concise, role-specific answers with context.

? Why Focus on Tech Firms?
Due to storage and computational constraints, I focused on publicly traded companies with significant market impact: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Netflix. This decision allowed me to optimize the system for quality and ensure the insights provided are relevant and reliable.

? Challenges and Limitations
Building RAGify came with its share of challenges:
	?	Publicly Traded Companies Only: The system is limited to companies that file 10-Ks with the SEC.
	?	Data Scope: Focused on six major tech companies and their 2019-2024 filings due to storage limitations.
	?	Model Constraints: Falcon-7B, an open-source model, has a limited context window, occasionally resulting in incomplete answers.

? What RAGify Does
RAGify uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect queries with relevant data. Ask questions like:
	?	?What are Apple?s financial risks in 2023??
	?	?How did geopolitical tensions impact Google in 2022??

And receive concise answers backed by referenced sections from the 10-K filings.

While this is just a foundational system, it?s a step toward leveraging AI for actionable insights. I?m actively improving it to address model limitations like incomplete responses and hallucinations, which are common challenges in the field.

? I?d love your thoughts! Let?s connect to explore the possibilities of AI-driven financial analysis and discuss how such systems can evolve for broader applications.

During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on the Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MHCV) Demand Forecasting project, where I developed and implemented forecasting models like SARIMAX, WaveNet, and Prophet, significantly improving forecast accuracy for the Component Business Unit of Cummins. This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to dive deep into the complexities of market drivers and sales forecasting in the manufacturing industry.

I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Rakesh Ranjan Srivastava, who not only entrusted me with this impactful project but also provided invaluable insights into the manufacturing industry. His guidance was instrumental in helping me understand the key market drivers for sales, which were crucial for the success of the project.

I am also extremely grateful to Aman Jaipuria for his unwavering support throughout the project. Aman?s expertise in the technical aspects of the project, including understanding the different algorithms used, was invaluable. His guidance during our daily stand-up meetings ensured that I stayed on track and continually improved my work.

This experience has not only deepened my knowledge in data science and machine learning but has also given me a greater appreciation for the collaborative efforts that drive successful projects. I am excited to take these learnings forward into my future endeavors.

Thank you, Cummins Inc., for this incredible opportunity, and thank you, Rakesh and Aman, for your mentorship and support!
