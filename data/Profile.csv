My experience spans time-series forecasting, predictive modeling, A/B testing, LLMs, and cloud-based data pipelines, with applications across finance, healthcare, and commercial industries.  With hands-on experience in SQL, Python, Apache Spark, AWS, and Power BI, Iâ€™ve worked on forecasting models, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and real-time analytics. During my internship at Cummins Inc., I developed time-series forecasting models that improved demand prediction accuracy by 20%, built SQL-driven Power BI dashboards, and deployed an AWS-based experimentation pipeline for pricing strategy optimization. At Atomic Loops, I designed an AI-powered prescription analytics system, improving personalized drug recommendations by 80% and contributing to securing $600K in funding.  Beyond technical expertise, I thrive in cross-functional collaborations, working closely with engineering, product, and business teams to drive data-driven decision-making. I am always eager to learn, experiment, and explore how AI and data science can transform industries.",Software Development,22043,"Falls Church, Virginia, United States",,,
